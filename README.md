# Bamazon
##### Created by Matt Petrower

Bamazon is a CLI app that functions as an online store. It uses a database for storing and receiving all data pertaining to the products for sale.

It first displays all items for sale and prompts the user to enter the ID number of the product they would like to purchase.

The user may then specify the quantity that they would like to purchase.

![Not Enough in Stock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msp9612/bamazon-node-app/master/images/bamNotEnough.PNG "Not Enough in Stock")

If there are not enough items in stock, the app resets and displays all items again.

The purchase will succeed if there are enough items in stock. The product, quantity and total cost are all displayed.

The app then resets and the user can make another purchase.
